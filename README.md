# Hello ![waving hand emoji](https://github.com/fafa-a/fafa-a/blob/main/assets/waving-hand.gif)

My name is Fabien Puech, junior web developper. I enjoy working on web automations, with headless browser. Currently learning Vue.js and Nuxt.js frameworks, my goal is to develop my Javascript skills. I don't mind working on both front-end or back-end code.
